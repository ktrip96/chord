# toyChord :innocent:


This is a project assigned to us from National and Technical University of Athens.

## Description of project

ToyChord is a distributed database. :floppy_disk:

It consists of many nodes (computers throughout the internet) that communicate between each other through sockets.
Each node can:
- create server and client processes
- open socket connections
- respond to incoming queries

##### GIF explaining
Everytime I run the script, I am actually adding a new virtual computer into the Distributed Database System. The Front End is updated immediately, because it communicates with the system via sockets.


The technologies we used: 
- **Node Js**
- **React JS**
- **Socket.io**
